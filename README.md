### Example Gameplay
```
ðŸŒ² Welcome to the Forest Adventure! ðŸŒ²
Make choices by entering numbers to navigate through the story.

==================================================
You wake up in a mysterious forest. The path splits in two directions.
[1] Take the left path (dark and ominous)
[2] Take the right path (bright and cheerful)
==================================================

Enter your choice (number): 1
```

### Troubleshooting

- If you get "command not found" for `node`, ensure Node.js is installed
- If choices don't work, make sure you're typing only numbers (1, 2, 3, etc.)
- The game automatically ends when you reach a conclusion

Enjoy your adventure in the mysterious forest! ðŸŽ®
